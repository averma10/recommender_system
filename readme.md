This is the initial commit. It contains all the codes and some important figures to display my python skills. Since I am still implementing it in an open source library, I am not releasing complete code at this moment and I have added some random bugs in this version to restrict its use by others.

**Most of the code has been written by Anuj Verma. References have been sited within the functions whenever I borrowed it.**
